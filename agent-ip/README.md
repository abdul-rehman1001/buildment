# Agent IP — Course Factory

**Status:** v0.1 — draft for team review
**Owner:** Delivery lead (Sean) + course engineering
**Applies to:** every course produced for the platform

## What this is

This folder is the instruction set for the agents that design, write, critique, and ship our courses. It is deliberately more than a style guide. It defines the product promise, the agent workflow, the content standards, the interaction grammar, the assessment model, the quality gates, and the human review process.

The documents are written to be read by both people and sub-agents. A sub-agent should be able to open this folder, find its role, load the relevant context, and produce an artifact that another agent can review without guessing what was intended.

## The production model

We do not write courses one at a time from a blank page. We build them in three layers:

1. **Skill spine** — the durable engineering capabilities every course must teach: product thinking, data modelling, API design, auth and authorization, async work, testing, security, performance, deployment, and the ability to defend decisions.
2. **General course** — one approved, domain-specific course that instantiates the spine. It defines the project shape, chapter archetypes, interaction grammar, assessment style, and production bar. Example: an event ticketing platform.
3. **Variants** — five or six concrete courses derived from the general course. Variants keep the spine and learning outcomes, but change the domain, primary user journey, hardest constraint, data model, hero feature, visual identity, and capstone evidence. The goal is that two learners who complete different variants do not have the same portfolio project.

The general course is the template. Variants are products, not reskins.

## The course promise

A learner who finishes a course has:

- built and deployed a real product, not followed a tutorial;
- made and defended architectural decisions;
- handled failure, security, and production concerns;
- produced evidence a mentor can inspect;
- and can explain the system without notes.

The course must be hard enough to produce that outcome and structured enough that a determined learner can finish it in 3–4 weeks at roughly 10 hours per day (210–280 focused hours).

## The instructor roadmap gate

Before the general course is written, the curriculum roadmap is confirmed by the instructors who will teach it. The roadmap is the one-page promise of what the learner will do, in what order, at what cost in hours, with what capstone, and with what explicitly left out. It is not a table of contents, and it is not the course.

The instructors answer seven questions: is this the right sequence, are these the right outcomes, is the time budget realistic for our learners, what is missing that you would refuse to teach without, what would you cut, do the variants represent the audiences we serve, and is the capstone something you would be proud to review.

**No blueprint, sample chapter, or general course is written until at least two instructors sign the confirmation record.** If they cannot confirm the roadmap, we revise it or cut scope. We do not write first and ask later. See `02-course-architecture.md` → The curriculum roadmap gate and `08-templates.md` → Curriculum roadmap / Roadmap confirmation record.

## Interactive canvases

Some concepts are best taught by letting the learner manipulate a small causal model: a token bucket, a seat-hold race, a cloud cost simulator, a queue under backpressure. These are **interactive canvases** — focused widgets with two to four inputs, an immediate visual output, and a stated model limit. They are deliberately simple: neutral surfaces, one accent, semantic color only, direct labels, no decoration. They may be rendered with HTML/CSS, inline SVG, or Canvas 2D; SVG is the default for charts, seat maps, timelines, and other vector visuals, while HTML owns the controls.

See `10-interactive-canvases.md` for the design language, model contract, platform integration, catalog, placement rules, and QA. The builder agent is `agents/interactive-canvas-builder.md`.

## How to use this folder

1. **Human intake.** Complete `08-templates.md` → Course Brief. State the audience, the outcome, the constraints, the variants, and the non-goals.
2. **Orchestrator.** The orchestrator reads `agents/orchestrator.md`, creates the work area, and runs the phase gates in order.
3. **Research.** A research agent produces a sourced dossier. No course prose is written before the dossier is accepted.
4. **Curriculum roadmap.** The curriculum architect, prerequisites/timeline agent, and project designer produce a short, instructor-facing roadmap: outcomes, module and chapter sequence, hours, prerequisites, capstone, variants, and out-of-scope. It is not the full blueprint and it is not the course.
5. **Instructor confirmation.** The instructors who will teach the course review the roadmap and sign it off. **No blueprint, sample chapter, or general course is written until this sign-off exists.** If they request changes, the roadmap is revised and re-confirmed.
6. **Detailed architecture.** Only after the roadmap is confirmed, the curriculum architect and project designer turn it into the blueprint, skill graph, time budget, and project brief.
7. **Interaction design.** The interaction designer maps every concept to the smallest interaction that proves understanding. Where a causal model is the best teacher, the designer specifies an interactive canvas — a small simulator or visualiser — and the canvas builder implements it.
8. **Writing.** Chapter writers draft from briefs, never from a blank page.
9. **Critique.** Independent critics review blind against `06-quality-gates.md`. Writers revise. Two rounds maximum before a human decision.
10. **Human review.** The board reviews the sample chapter, full draft, and variants at the gates defined in `09-review-and-governance.md`.
11. **Variants.** The variant producer derives 5–6 courses and proves they are meaningfully different. Each variant roadmap is confirmed before variant chapters are written.
12. **Publish.** Technical validation, platform import, accessibility, and final sign-off.

## Gates

| Gate | Decision | Who decides |
|---|---|---|
| G0 | Brief and scope accepted | Human sponsor |
| G1 | Research dossier accepted | Curriculum architect + human |
| G2A | Curriculum roadmap drafted | Curriculum architect + prerequisites/timeline |
| G2B | Roadmap confirmed by instructors | Instructor panel |
| G2C | Detailed blueprint, skill graph, timeline, and project brief accepted | Human review board |
| G3 | Interaction map, canvas specs if any, and one sample chapter accepted | Human review board |
| G4 | Full draft complete | Orchestrator |
| G5 | Technical and pedagogical QA passed, including canvas QA | Critics + technical validator |
| G6 | Variant roadmaps confirmed, variants distinct and complete | Human review board + instructor panel |
| G7 | Publish approved | Delivery lead |

No agent may skip a gate. No model may approve its own output.

## Non-negotiables

- **Prose carries the teaching.** Bullets summarise; they do not replace explanation.
- **Specific beats generic.** Every example names a real product, a real constraint, or a real failure mode.
- **One hard thing at a time.** Complexity is sequenced, not dumped.
- **Every interaction earns its place.** If it does not produce evidence of understanding, cut it.
- **Depth over coverage.** A smaller course taught deeply beats a broad course taught shallowly.
- **Withhold solutions, not context.** Learners get constraints, interfaces, and acceptance tests — not a complete implementation to paste.
- **Every technical claim is verified.** Versions, commands, APIs, and links are run or checked before publish.
- **No AI slop.** The forbidden patterns in `00-principles.md` are hard failures, not preferences.
- **Human sign-off is final.** Automation prepares the decision; it does not make it.
- **Instructors confirm the roadmap before we write the course.** No blueprint, sample chapter, or general course until the instructor panel signs the roadmap. This is the cheapest place to prevent a course that nobody wants to teach.
- **Canvases are simple, not decorative.** An interactive canvas must make one causal model legible. Neutral palette, one accent, semantic color only, no gradients or confetti. If the learner cannot state the claim afterwards, cut it.
- **SVG is rendered through a component, never injected raw.** Use React SVG components with `viewBox`, theme tokens, `<title>`/`<desc>`, and keyboard-reachable shapes. Raw author SVG in MDX is forbidden.

## Work areas

Do not write generated course content into this folder. Use:

- `agent-ip/work/<course-slug>/` for in-progress briefs, research, blueprints, critiques, and QA.
- `courses/<course-slug>/` for approved course source ready to import.
- `content/import/<course-slug>/` only when the platform importer is wired for that course.

## Change control

This IP is a living document. Changes go through the review process in `09-review-and-governance.md`. When a rule changes, update the version, the decision log, and any affected agent prompt in the same change. Do not leave two competing instructions in the folder.
