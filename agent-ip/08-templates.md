# Chapter 03.04 — Reserve inventory

## Outcome
<One observable sentence.>

## Prose target
<≥ 1,200 prose words for a concept/build chapter; ≥ 700 for a checkpoint/gate. List what the prose must cover: problem, mechanism, worked example, trade-offs, failure modes, debugging.>

## Hook
<The concrete problem or failure.>

<The minimum theory. Name the mechanism, not only the vocabulary.>

## Worked example
<An adjacent case, solved with reasoning. Process-oriented for novices; product-oriented when the learner is ready.>

## Decision
<The trade-off the learner must make. Alternatives and the consequence of each.>

## Alternatives and tools
<Credible alternatives, open-source/managed options, when to switch, operational cost.>

## Build
<The task. File paths, interfaces, constraints, acceptance criteria.>

## Failure modes
<What breaks, how to detect it, and the debugging path.>

## Verify
<Command/test/screenshot, including one failure mode.>

## Interactions
<Exact blocks and placement. Link to interaction-map.yaml.>

## Canvas
<Canvas spec slug, or "none". State the teaching claim and why the canvas is better than a static diagram.>

## Reflect
<Retrieval or learning-log prompt.>

## Bridge
<What this unlocks and what comes next.>

        budget: 1
      - type: CANVAS

        budget: 1
      - type: CHECKLIST
        placement: end
        purpose: Verify the learner can state the invariant and the failure mode
        budget: 1
    density:
      big_word_alerts: 1
      diagrams: 0
      callouts: 1

## 9. Assessment plan

```yaml
---
artifact: assessment-plan
course: <slug>
version: 1
owner: assessment-designer
---

outcomes:
  - id: O4
    statement: <outcome>
    level: application | analysis | evaluation | creation
    evidence:
      - type: QUIZ
        chapter: 03.05
        proves: <what it proves>
      - type: CAPSTONE
        milestone: <milestone>
        proves: <what it proves>
    rubric:
      - dimension: invariant
        weight: 0.4
        descriptors:
          4: <observable>
          3: <observable>
          2: <observable>
          1: <observable>
```

Before sign-off, check every `QUIZ`, `PREDICT`, and knowledge-check set: the correct option must not be the longest by default, option lengths must be comparable, and the correct position must vary. A set where the longest option is correct in half or more of the questions is not ready.

## 14A. Interactive canvas spec

```yaml

slug: <stable-slug>
version: 1
owner: interaction-designer

# Canvas spec — <title>

## Teaching claim
<One sentence the learner should be able to state afterwards.>

## Why a canvas
<Why a static diagram or worked example is not enough.>

## Model
- Inputs:
  | Name | Unit | Min | Max | Step | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
- Outputs:
  | Name | Unit | Format |
  |---|---|---|
- Formula or rule:
- Assumptions:
- Limitations:

## Rendering
- Primary: HTML/CSS | inline SVG | Canvas 2D
- Why this renderer:
- SVG structure: viewBox, layers, element count, theme tokens
- Controls: HTML controls (never SVG form controls)
- Static fallback:

## Controls
<Sliders, steppers, toggles, presets. Why each control exists.>

## Visualisation
<Chart, bucket, timeline, matrix, map. One idea. Direct labels.>

## Copy
- What this shows:
- Try this:
  1.
  2.
- What changed: <how the live delta is worded>
- Limits of the model:

## Edge cases
<Zero, maximum, invalid input, no data, long labels, mobile.>

## Accessibility
<Keyboard, labels, text alternative, reduced motion, contrast.>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] The claim is testable.
- [ ] The model is tested.
- [ ] The design is simple and legible.
- [ ] Prediction before, transfer check after.
- [ ] Reader fallback exists.

## Build plan
<Component path, model path, test path, registry slug, preview route.>
```
