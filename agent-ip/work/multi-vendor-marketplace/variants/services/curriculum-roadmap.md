# Curriculum roadmap: SkillSlot (services variant of FreshMarket)

## In one paragraph

The learner builds SkillSlot, a marketplace where freelancers sell their time: a maths tutor, an English conversation tutor, a brand designer, an electrician, a laptop repair technician. Providers set weekly working hours in their own time zone, list fixed-price services with a duration, and block time off when plans change. Clients find a provider, pick a free time shown in their own time zone, put one or more time slots from different providers in one cart, and pay once with Stripe test mode. Checkout splits into one order per provider (as in FreshMarket) and one booking per time slot. The hard part is time itself: two clients must never get the same hour of the same provider, even when they click at the same moment, and "15:00" must mean the same instant to a client in Berlin and a tutor in Gaza. At the end the learner can model bookings, prevent double booking under concurrency, handle time zones and daylight saving, cancel and reschedule with correct refunds, deploy the system, and defend every one of those decisions.

## Learner and entry prerequisites

- Learner: fellows in Gaza building tech careers. English is often a second language. Many study on phones with unreliable power and internet, so chapters stay short, builds are checkpointed, and every gate can be passed offline except deploy and Stripe steps.
- Prior knowledge: same as FreshMarket. JavaScript fundamentals, HTTP request and response, one prior CRUD app, Git and the command line, basic data modelling.
- Time available: 3 to 4 weeks at about 10 hours a day. Core path 206 hours, stretch path up to about 265 hours.
- Entry diagnostic: the FreshMarket diagnostic plus four questions on JavaScript `Date` (what `new Date().toISOString()` prints, what a UTC offset is, why `"2026-03-28 00:30"` alone is ambiguous, and how many minutes are in a day that has a clock change). Learners who miss two or more get the short repair read in chapter 1.5 before Module 5.

## Outcomes

| # | Outcome (observable verb) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Model a multi-provider services marketplace with ownership chains, price and policy snapshots, and bookings as their own collection | ERD in `docs/erd.md`, seed script, viva answer on why Booking is not embedded |
| O2 | Implement registration, login, refresh tokens and OTP with role-aware JWT | curl flow and passing auth tests (as FreshMarket) |
| O3 | Enforce object-level authorization so a provider cannot read or change another provider's services or bookings, and private client data is shown only to the other party of a confirmed booking | `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md` and IDOR tests that return 403 |
| O4 | Generate bookable slots from weekly rules written in the provider's local time, store instants in UTC, and stay correct across daylight saving changes and between two time zones | clock test suite and engine tests, including a week with a clock change |
| O5 | Prevent double booking under concurrency with atomic slot claims and expiring holds | parallel booking script: 20 attempts on one slot, exactly one success, logged in `docs/EVIDENCE.md` |
| O6 | Take one Stripe test-mode payment for a multi-provider cart, split it into per-provider orders and bookings, confirm by webhook idempotently, and refund one booking partially on cancellation | Stripe test dashboard events, refund records on the order, webhook replay test |
| O7 | Move slow and scheduled work off the request path: confirmation messages, reminders as delayed jobs, hold expiry sweeps, cache invalidation | worker logs, reminder moved after a reschedule, cache bust on booking |
| O8 | Deploy the API, client and worker over HTTPS and defend the design in a demo and viva | live URL, restart survival test, five-minute demo video, viva |

## Four-week shape

| Week | Focus | Modules | Hours | Demo at the end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations and the clock | M1 to M8 | 57 | Both apps run; MongoDB runs as a replica set; seed has providers and clients in three time zones; clock tests pass, including a clock-change week; register and log in |
| 2 | Provider experience and the availability engine | M9 to M15 | 52 | A provider opens a practice, adds services and a photo, sets weekly hours and time off, and the API returns correct free slots for the next 7 days |
| 3 | Client experience: book and pay | M16 to M21 | 50 | A client in Berlin sees a Gaza tutor's slots in Berlin time, books two providers in one cart, pays with a Stripe test card, and both providers see their bookings; a parallel attempt on the same slot gets a 409 |
| 4 | Change, scale, ship and defend | M22 to M28 | 47 | Cancel with a policy-based partial refund, reschedule with reminders moved, cached search, live HTTPS URL, concurrency evidence, coupons, five-minute demo |
| | **Core total** | 28 modules | **206** | |

Hours are planned learner hours, including building and debugging, not reading time. For reference, the FreshMarket chapter frontmatter (`estimatedMinutes`) sums to about 132 hours of step time, and its outline plans 4 weeks at about 60 hours a week. This roadmap keeps under the 210-hour core cap with 4 hours of slack.

## Capstone

- What the learner ships: SkillSlot live over HTTPS with API, client and worker; seeded providers in `Asia/Gaza` and clients in three zones; docs (ERD, authorization matrix, architecture, evidence, demo script).
- Five-minute demo:
  1. Provider view: weekly hours in Gaza time, a blocked afternoon for a power cut.
  2. Client in Berlin: the same tutor's slots in Berlin time, with Gaza time beside them.
  3. Book a tutor and a designer in one cart, pay once with a Stripe test card, show one order per provider and one booking per slot.
  4. Run the parallel script: 20 attempts on one slot, one success.
  5. Reschedule one booking: the old slot comes back, the reminder job moves.
  6. Cancel the other inside the late window: a partial refund appears in Stripe test mode and on the order.
- Defense questions:
  - Why store a UTC instant plus an IANA zone, and not a local time with an offset?
  - Why one claim per 15-minute block instead of an overlap query before insert?
  - What happens when a payment succeeds after the hold expired and someone else took the time?
  - Why is a booking its own collection when FreshMarket embeds order lines?
  - How do you refund one booking from a payment that covered two providers?
  - If Redis is down or stale, can a double booking happen? Why not?
  - A provider moves from Gaza to Doha and changes their zone. What happens to next week's rules and to existing bookings?
  - How do you stop one client from holding every free hour of a popular tutor?
- Production requirements: unique index on claims; transactions on a replica set; webhook signature checked; webhook and refund handling idempotent; server clock in UTC with correctness that does not depend on it; hold limits and rate limits; need-to-know fields enforced on the server; reminder processors re-check state before sending.

## Variants

| Variant | Primary user | Hardest constraint | Hero feature | Data-model delta | Capstone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FreshMarket (general) | Local grocery shops and shoppers | Stock counts and price snapshots across a split checkout | Multi-vendor cart split into per-vendor orders | Product with stock, StockReservation, embedded order lines | Split checkout and reservations demo |
| **services (this roadmap)** | Freelancers (tutors, designers, electricians) and their clients | Exclusive time on one provider's calendar, across time zones, with holds, cancellations and reschedules | Availability and booking | Service, AvailabilityRule, TimeOff, SlotClaim, Booking as its own collection | Two-zone booking, parallel race, reschedule and partial refund |
| handmade | Artisans (tatreez, olive wood, ceramics) and buyers | One-off items and made-to-order requests | Custom order flow | Per its own producer | Per its own producer |
| home-kitchens | Home cooks and diners | Prep times, order cutoffs, delivery windows | Live order tracking | Per its own producer | Per its own producer |
| digital-goods | Creators of templates, fonts, ebooks | No shipping, instant delivery after payment | Licensing and signed download links | Per its own producer | Per its own producer |
| books | Students and small bookshops | Condition grades and used-item pricing | Search and recommendations | Per its own producer | Per its own producer |

## Out of scope

- Payouts to providers (Stripe Connect). FreshMarket also charges to one platform account; payouts add onboarding and compliance work that does not teach the spine.
- Video calls. The provider adds a meeting link; SkillSlot only decides who may see it.
- Two-way sync with Google or Outlook calendars. It needs OAuth and conflict handling that would double the scope. One-way .ics download is in core; a subscription feed is stretch.
- Quotes and custom requests. Every service has a fixed price and duration. This keeps the variant clear of the handmade custom order flow.
- Delivery windows and capacity per window. This keeps the variant clear of home-kitchens.
- Map or radius search. In-person services use a list of service areas.
- SMS and push notifications. Messages are mocked in the worker, as in FreshMarket.
- Taxes, invoices, disputes and multi-currency.

## Open decisions for instructors

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Instructor decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | When is a slot held: at add-to-cart or at checkout start? | At checkout start, for 10 minutes. Holding at add-to-cart lets idle carts block calendars for hours. | |
| 2 | Block size for claims | 15 minutes. Services and buffers must be whole blocks. 30 minutes is simpler but too coarse for a 45-minute lesson. | |
| 3 | Make a replica set mandatory so transactions are always available | Yes. Atlas free clusters are replica sets; locally, a single-node replica set. FreshMarket made transactions optional; here all-or-nothing checkout and reschedule depend on them. | |
| 4 | Time library | Luxon, which uses the runtime's `Intl` time zone data. Alternatives: date-fns-tz, or the Temporal API if the course's Node version supports it. | |
| 5 | Payment capture | Automatic capture in core, with refund when a late payment loses its slot. Manual capture as stretch S3. | |
| 6 | Course currency | One currency for the whole course, as FreshMarket. Confirm the chosen currency works in Stripe test mode on the course account before writing. | |
| 7 | Keep coupons (M27) in core | Yes, at 5 hours, to keep FreshMarket's pricing trust outcome. Move to stretch only if M22 needs more time. | |
| 8 | Keep one in-person service type (electrician home visit) in core | Yes. It is the reason for need-to-know address rules and buffers. No travel-time calculation. | |
| 9 | Can a provider move a booking without asking? | No. In core a provider can only cancel with a full refund. Proposing a new time is stretch S4. | |
| 10 | Product name | Keep SkillSlot as the reference name; learners may name their own product, as in FreshMarket. | |
