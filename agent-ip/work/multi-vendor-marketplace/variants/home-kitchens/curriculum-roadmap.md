# Curriculum roadmap: Sufra, a marketplace for home kitchens

## In one paragraph

The learner builds Sufra (working name; learners may rename it), a marketplace where home cooks sell cooked meals to diners in their neighbourhood. A cook opens a kitchen, sets which delivery windows they cook for and how much they can cook in each one, and lists dishes with a prep time and a "load" (how much of the kitchen's capacity one portion uses). A diner picks a delivery window first ("today, 13:00 to 14:00"), sees only the kitchens that can still cook for that window, orders from one or more kitchens in a single checkout, pays with Stripe in test mode, and then watches the order move from "placed" to "delivered" on a phone, even on a weak or dropping connection. The hard part is not stock. A kitchen has no shelf of products: it has a fixed amount of cooking time per window, every dish has its own order cutoff that depends on its prep time, and the clock keeps moving. At the end the learner can model time-bound capacity, prevent overbooking a window under concurrent checkouts, run an order state machine with a cook acceptance deadline, push live status updates with server-sent events that survive reconnects, deploy the system, and defend each decision.

## Learner and entry prerequisites

- Learner: fellows in Gaza building tech careers. English is often a second language. Many work on phones, with unreliable power and internet. The course uses plain English, short sentences and small downloads.
- Prior knowledge: JavaScript fundamentals, HTTP request and response, one prior CRUD app, Git and the command line, basic document data modelling. Same baseline as FreshMarket.
- Time available: 3 to 4 weeks at about 10 hours a day. Core path 210 hours, stretch to 280 hours.
- Entry diagnostic: the FreshMarket diagnostic, plus three questions on dates: convert a UTC time to a local time, compare two times correctly in JavaScript, and explain why `new Date()` on the client cannot decide whether an order is late. Learners who miss these get a short repair read on `Date`, UTC and time zones before Module 14.

## Outcomes

| # | Outcome (observable verb) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | Model kitchens, dishes, delivery windows and capacity claims with clear ownership | ERD in `docs/erd.md`, seed script that creates 7 days of windows, viva answer on why a dish has no stock field |
| O2 | Implement authentication and role plus ownership authorization for diners and cooks | Tests: a cook cannot read another kitchen's orders; a diner cannot open another diner's tracking stream |
| O3 | Compute delivery windows and per-dish cutoffs in the kitchen's time zone using the server clock | Fake-clock tests at the exact cutoff boundary, including a daylight saving change day |
| O4 | Prevent overbooking a window when many diners check out at once | Parallel checkout script: 20 requests against 10 capacity units, log shows exactly the units that fit and clean `409 WINDOW_FULL` for the rest |
| O5 | Take payment for a multi-kitchen checkout and refund the part a cook rejects | Stripe test mode: one PaymentIntent, split orders, a partial refund for a rejected kitchen, webhook signature verified |
| O6 | Run an order lifecycle as a state machine with an acceptance deadline | Illegal transition returns 409; an order the cook ignores is rejected and refunded by a delayed job |
| O7 | Deliver live order status that survives weak connections | Recorded offline test: network off for 60 seconds while the cook advances two steps, then the timeline replays in order with no duplicates |
| O8 | Deploy and operate the API, worker, Redis and the event stream on HTTPS | Live URL; stream works through the host's proxy; API and worker come back after restart and clients reconnect on their own |
| O9 | Defend the architecture | Five-minute demo plus viva, including the SSE versus WebSockets versus polling decision |

## Four-week shape

| Week | Focus | Modules | Hours | Demo at the end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations | 1 to 8 | 51 | Both apps run; seed shows kitchens, dishes and 7 days of windows in Compass; diner and cook can log in; isolation tests pass |
| 2 | Cook experience and the clock | 9 to 14 | 41 | Cook opens a kitchen, sets a weekly schedule, adds dishes with photos, and sees next week's windows with correct cutoffs |
| 3 | Diner experience and money | 15 to 21 | 53 | Diner picks a lunch window, orders from two kitchens, pays with a test card; holds expire on their own; notify jobs run in the worker |
| 4 | Live tracking, hardening, ship | 22 to 26, 99 | 53 | Deployed app: cook accepts, cooks, sends out; diner's phone updates live and recovers after going offline; capacity load test evidence |
| | Buffer | | 12 | |
| | **Core total** | | **210** | |

| 15 to 16 | Window-first browse; slow dish disappears after its cutoff while fast dish stays |
| 17 to 18 | Cart rejects past-cutoff lines; window change revalidates |
| 19 | 20 parallel checkouts, remaining units never negative, log committed |
| 20 | Test payment, webhook confirms claims, partial refund visible in Stripe test dashboard |
| 21 | Holds expire via worker; notify job deduplicated |
| 22 | Illegal transition 409; ignored order auto-rejected and refunded |
| 23 | Recorded offline test; isolation test passes |
| 24 | Menu cache with invalidation; capacity never cached |
| 25 | Live HTTPS; stream survives proxy and restart |
| 26 | Load and cutoff race evidence on the deployed app |
| 99 | Docs, demo video, viva |

## Capstone

- **What the learner ships:** Sufra on a live HTTPS URL with diner and cook surfaces, an API, a BullMQ worker, Redis for cache, queues and pub/sub, Stripe test-mode payments with partial refunds, and a resumable live tracking stream.
- **Five-minute demo (two phones or two browser windows):** (1) The diner picks today's 13:00 window and sees a slow dish already past its cutoff while fast dishes remain. (2) The diner orders from two kitchens and pays with a Stripe test card. (3) The first cook accepts; the second cook ignores the order, and it auto-rejects with a partial refund. (4) The first cook moves the order to cooking; the diner's phone goes offline; the cook marks it ready and out for delivery; the phone comes back and the timeline catches up in order. (5) The learner runs the parallel checkout script and shows the window filling exactly to capacity.
- **Defense questions:**
  1. Why does a dish have no stock field, and what plays the role of stock?
  2. Who decides that an order is too late, and why not the phone?
  3. Walk through the claim query. What stops two checkouts from taking the last units?
  4. Why SSE and not WebSockets? When would you switch?
  5. A Redis pub/sub message is lost. What does the diner see, and why is nothing lost for good?
  6. A cook ignores an order. Walk through every system that changes.
  7. What happens on the day the clocks change?
- **Production requirements:** secrets only in env; webhook signatures verified; every state change through the state machine; stream authorized per user; heartbeats so proxies keep the stream open; server-side totals and time checks; worker and API restart cleanly; logs show claim, payment and transition IDs.

## Variants

This roadmap is one variant of the FreshMarket general course.

| Variant | Primary user | Hardest constraint | Hero feature | Data-model delta | Capstone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FreshMarket (general) | Local grocery shops and shoppers | Stock quantity, overselling, price snapshots | Multi-vendor cart with split checkout | Store, Product with stock, StockReservation, Coupon | Split checkout and reservation concurrency evidence |
| **Home kitchens (this)** | Home cooks and diners | Cooking capacity per delivery window, per-dish cutoffs, the server clock | Live order tracking that survives weak connections | Kitchen with schedule, Dish without stock, DeliveryWindow, CapacityClaim, Order with timeline | Two-phone live demo with offline replay and window load test |
| Services | Freelancers and clients | Booked time slots, no double booking | Availability and booking | Defined in that variant | Defined in that variant |
| Handmade | Artisans and buyers | One-off items and made-to-order requests | Custom order flow | Defined in that variant | Defined in that variant |
| Digital goods | Creators and buyers | Instant delivery after payment | Licensing and signed download links | Defined in that variant | Defined in that variant |
| Books | Students and small bookshops | Condition grades and used-item pricing | Search and recommendations | Defined in that variant | Defined in that variant |

## Out of scope

- **Live GPS maps and a rider app.** Location tracking costs data on weak connections, raises privacy questions for riders, and would not fit the time budget. Tracking is status based. A rider role is stretch S6.
- **Paying cooks out.** Stripe Connect payouts need real business onboarding. Money stays in the platform's test account.
- **Real SMS, email or push in the core path.** Notifications are console logs from the worker, as in FreshMarket. Web Push is stretch S4.
- **Food safety certification and legal advice.** One self-declaration step only. Rules differ by place and are not ours to teach.
- **Full right-to-left Arabic interface.** Arabic dish names may appear in seed data and search (open decision 8).
- **Ratings, reviews and dynamic pricing.** Not needed to prove the outcomes.
- **Promotions in the core path.** Moved to stretch S1 to make room for the lifecycle and tracking modules.

## Open decisions for instructors

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Instructor decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Live transport: SSE with polling fallback, WebSockets (for example Socket.IO), or polling only | SSE with polling fallback. Updates only flow server to client; `EventSource` reconnects by itself; it is plain HTTP, so it passes most proxies. WebSockets become stretch S3 | |
| 2 | How the stream is authorized, since `EventSource` cannot send an `Authorization` header | An httpOnly, SameSite cookie if client and API share a site; otherwise a single-use stream ticket that expires in about a minute | |
| 3 | All-or-nothing claims across kitchens: compensating release or a MongoDB transaction | Compensating release with idempotent claim IDs in the core path. Transactions need a replica set, so local Docker would have to run a single-node replica set; offer transactions as a discussion | |
| 4 | Handling a rejected kitchen: automatic capture plus partial refund, or manual capture on acceptance | Automatic capture plus partial refund in core (simpler, close to FreshMarket); manual capture is stretch S2 | |
| 5 | Unit of capacity: load units per dish, portions, or prep minutes | Load units per dish. Portions ignore that one tray of maqluba takes more effort than one sandwich; minutes are hard for cooks to estimate | |
| 6 | Who delivers in the core path | The kitchen delivers or the diner collects; status only. Rider persona is stretch S6 | |
| 7 | Moving promotions (FreshMarket 25) to stretch | Yes, to keep the core path at 210 hours | |
| 8 | Arabic dish names in seed data and search | Yes, names in both scripts in seed data; English UI; no RTL layout work | |
| 9 | Hosting choice for Module 25 | Pick a host where a long-lived streaming response has been tested before the cohort starts; record the result in the deploy chapter | |
| 10 | Product name | "Sufra" as the working name; learners may rename it, as in FreshMarket | |
