# Curriculum roadmap: Midad (digital-goods variant)

## In one paragraph

The learner builds **Midad**, a marketplace where independent creators sell digital goods: font families, design and CV templates, icon packs and short ebooks. A buyer can fill one cart from several creators, pay once in Stripe test mode, and find every item in their library a few seconds later, with a license key and a download button. There is no stock and no shipping. The hard part moves somewhere else: access must be granted exactly once by a verified payment webhook, files must stay private and only leave storage through short-lived links issued by the server, each license carries limits (downloads, seats) that must hold under parallel requests, and a refund must take access away again. By the end, the learner can deploy this system and defend every one of those decisions without notes.

## Learner and entry prerequisites

- **Learner:** fellows in Gaza building tech careers. English is a second language. Many work on phones or shared laptops, with unreliable power and internet. Same audience as FreshMarket.
- **Prior knowledge:** JavaScript fundamentals, HTTP request and response, one CRUD app built before, Git and the command line, basic data modelling. Same as FreshMarket.
- **Time available:** 4 weeks at about 10 hours per day. Core path 210 hours, stretch path up to 246 hours.
- **Entry diagnostic:** the FreshMarket diagnostic, plus two questions: "What is the difference between a URL that is secret and a URL that is signed?" and "Two requests read `remaining: 1` at the same time. What happens next?" Wrong answers route to a short repair page, not a block.

## Outcomes

| # | Outcome (observable verb) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | **Model** a digital catalogue where the public listing and the private deliverable are separate records with separate access rules | `docs/erd.md`; a catalogue API response that contains no private file id or URL |
| O2 | **Enforce** role and object ownership for studios, licenses and seats | `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`; IDOR tests where buyer B is refused buyer A's download |
| O3 | **Take** one test-mode payment for a multi-creator cart, priced on the server, split into one order per creator | Stripe test dashboard payment; order documents with price, license type and terms version snapshots |
| O4 | **Fulfil** each order line exactly once from a verified Stripe webhook | Replay of the same event that creates no second license; webhook log |
| O5 | **Deliver** private files through expiring links issued by the server, and log every issuance | Expired link that fails; `DownloadGrant` records |
| O6 | **Hold** download limits and seat limits under concurrent requests | Parallel test output: 20 requests, exactly N succeed |
| O7 | **Revoke** access after a full or partial refund, without touching other creators' orders | Refund demo; license verify endpoint answers `revoked` |
| O8 | **Move** side effects off the request path and **reconcile** payments whose webhook was missed | Worker logs; a reconciliation run that fulfils a checkout with a dropped webhook |
| O9 | **Deploy** the API, worker and client, and **defend** the design | Live HTTPS URL; five-minute demo; viva |

## Four-week shape

| Week | Focus | Modules | Hours | Demo at the end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations | 1 to 7 | 51 | Both apps run; creator and buyer can register and log in; seed shows a product with two license options and a private file record |
| 2 | Creator experience | 8 to 15 | 55 | A creator opens a studio, lists a product with public previews and a private file; buyers browse it; the catalogue never exposes the private file |
| 3 | Buy, fulfil, download | 16 to 21 | 48 | A buyer pays once for items from two creators; the webhook fills the library within seconds; downloads work through expiring links |
| 4 | Harden and ship | 22 to 26, 99 | 48 + 8 buffer | Live on HTTPS; limits hold under a parallel test; a refund revokes one creator's license and leaves the other working |
| | **Core total** | | **210** | |

## Module and chapter sequence

Status labels compare each module with FreshMarket:

- **Carry over:** almost unchanged. Same build, new nouns.
- **Adapted:** same skill, but the domain changes the build, the decision or the test.
- **New:** no FreshMarket equivalent, or it replaces a FreshMarket module with different content of the same learning weight.

A "chapter" below is a cluster of sub-chapters in the FreshMarket format (set the scene, learn, check, build steps, checklist). Sub-chapter lists are written at the blueprint stage (G2C), not here.

Hours: 10

| # | Chapter | One-line outcome | Type | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 21.1 | How a time-limited link works | Explain that the link carries an expiry and a signature made with a secret only the server holds, and that anyone holding the link can use it until it expires | Learn | 1.5 |

## Capstone

- **What the learner ships:** Midad live on HTTPS. Creators open studios, list products with public previews, private files and personal and commercial license options. Buyers pay once for items from several creators in Stripe test mode, get licenses and keys from the webhook within seconds, and download through expiring links. Limits hold under parallel requests. A refund revokes the right licenses and no others.
- **Five-minute demo:**
  1. (0:00) Creator view: a product with two license options and a private file. Show the public catalogue JSON: no private file id, no URL.
  2. (1:00) Buyer view: cart with items from two creators, one payment with a test card.
  3. (1:45) Show the webhook delivery (Stripe CLI or dashboard) and the library filling on the success page.
  4. (2:30) Download a file. Copy the link, wait past its expiry, show it fails. Ask for a new link from the library: it works and the remaining count drops.
  5. (3:15) Run the parallel script: 20 download requests on a license with 3 remaining; exactly 3 links are issued.
  6. (4:00) Creator A refunds their order. A's license is revoked, the verify endpoint says `revoked`, creator B's license still downloads.
  7. (4:40) Resend the original payment event. No new license appears.
- **Defense questions:**
  1. Why is the webhook, and not the success page, the thing that grants access?
  2. Stripe sends the same event twice at the same moment. Walk through what your code does.
  3. A buyer shares a download link in a group chat. What can the people in the chat do, and for how long?
  4. Why can a refund not take back a link you already issued? What did you choose to limit the damage?
  5. Why is the download endpoint a POST?
  6. Your download count counts issued links, not finished downloads. Defend that, or explain what you would change.
  7. Why does embedding seats in the license make seat assignment safe without a transaction?
  8. One payment covered two creators. How did you refund only one?
  9. What happens if your server is down when the payment succeeds?
- **Production requirements:** secrets only in env; test-mode keys only; webhook signature verified on every request; private files never reachable without a server-issued link; download, refund and verify routes rate limited; API and worker survive restart; every gate evidence item linked from the README.

## Variants

## Out of scope

- **DRM, watermarking and piracy prevention.** A buyer who downloads a file can copy it. The course teaches access control, not copy control, and says so plainly. PDF stamping is named as a possible extension.
- **Subscriptions and recurring billing.** One-time purchases only.
- **Payouts to creators (Stripe Connect), tax and VAT on digital goods.** Real and important, but a separate course. The platform holds test payments only.
- **Real legal license drafting.** The sample terms are short, plain and clearly marked as course samples, not legal advice.
- **Disputes and chargebacks.** Named in Module 26 as a case the same revocation path could handle, not built.
- **Video streaming and very large files.** Seed files stay small for learners on weak connections.
- **Live (non-test) payments.** Test mode only, as in FreshMarket.

## Technical claims to verify before chapters are written

The technical validator confirms these against current docs and the course's pinned versions:

1. Cloudinary: behaviour of `authenticated` raw uploads; `cloudinary.utils.private_download_url` with `expires_at` for time-limited downloads; that plain signed delivery URLs do not expire; which plans include token-based expiring delivery URLs; whether the "allow delivery of PDF and ZIP files" security setting affects this flow on a free account; the raw file size limit on the plan learners will use.
2. Stripe: the refund event set for the pinned API version (`charge.refunded` and the `refund.*` events); whether the Charge in the event payload includes its refunds list or needs a separate call; webhook retry behaviour in test mode; Stripe CLI commands used in Modules 19 and 20.
3. BullMQ: the current API for repeatable jobs (job schedulers) used in Module 23.
4. MongoDB: `$expr` with `$size` inside a `findOneAndUpdate` filter for the seat assignment in Module 25.
5. S3 (stretch only): presigned `GetObject` URL expiry limits for the credential type used.

## Open decisions for instructors

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Instructor decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Private file storage in the core path: Cloudinary (authenticated delivery and time-limited download URLs) or AWS S3 (presigned URLs) | Cloudinary in core. It is already in the FreshMarket stack and needs no new account. An AWS account needs a payment card at sign-up, which many fellows may not have. S3 stays as stretch S3, behind the same storage interface. | |
| 2 | Default link lifetime and what counts as one download | 5 minutes; count each issued link, not each finished download, and make the learner defend it. Streaming through the API to count bytes is named and rejected for cost. | |
| 3 | How license keys are stored | Store the random key as is, with a unique index, and show it only to the license holder behind auth. A key proves a purchase, not an identity, and buyers must be able to see it again. Hashing with show-once is discussed as the alternative. | |
| 4 | When access ends on refund: on request or on Stripe confirmation | Block new links as soon as the refund is requested; mark licenses `revoked` when the refund webhook confirms. | |
| 5 | Should the success page also trigger fulfilment (server retrieves the PaymentIntent and fulfils if it succeeded), as Stripe's fulfilment guide suggests for Checkout | Core: webhook only, success page polls; the reconciliation job in Module 23 covers missed webhooks. Mention the two-path pattern in the decision chapter. One writer is easier for beginners to reason about. | |
| 6 | Seats for commercial licenses in core or stretch | Core, in Module 25. It is the clearest lesson in "embedding buys atomicity" and costs about 2 hours. | |
| 7 | Who may refund | The creator, for their own order only. No admin role in core, to keep the role model the same as FreshMarket. | |
| 8 | Seed deliverables | Generated placeholder files (a small generated PDF, a ZIP with a README), not real fonts or ebooks, so no third-party license is involved and uploads work on a weak connection. | |
| 9 | Spelling | Use "license" in prose and code alike, so learners do not meet two spellings of one word. | |
