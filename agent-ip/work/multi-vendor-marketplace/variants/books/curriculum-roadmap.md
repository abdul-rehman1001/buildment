# Curriculum roadmap: Hamesh (books variant of FreshMarket)

## In one paragraph

The learner builds **Hamesh**, a marketplace where small bookshops list used and new copies of books, and university students find the exact editions on their course reading lists at a condition and price they can afford. A shop types an ISBN, the system finds or creates the shared edition record, and the shop adds a copy with an honest condition grade, defect notes, photos and a price. A student imports a course reading list, and the matcher picks the best copy for each title across all shops; titles that nobody has yet go onto a want-list, and the student gets an alert as soon as a matching copy is listed. Checkout still splits one payment into one order per shop, with Stripe in test mode. At the end the learner can model a shared catalogue with shop-owned copies, sell each physical copy exactly once, run standing matches in a background worker without duplicate alerts, deploy the system, and defend every one of those decisions.

The spine, stack (MongoDB, Express, React with Vite, Node.js, Redis, BullMQ, Cloudinary, Stripe test mode) and outcomes are the same as FreshMarket. The product, the data model, the hardest constraint and the hero feature are not.

## Learner and entry prerequisites

- **Learner:** fellows in Gaza building tech careers. English is a second language. Many work on phones or shared laptops, with unreliable power and internet. Plain English, short steps, work saved often.
- **Prior knowledge:** JavaScript fundamentals, HTTP request and response, one CRUD app built before, Git and the command line, basic data modelling. Same as FreshMarket.
- **Time available:** 3 to 4 weeks at about 10 hours per day. Core path 210 hours, stretch path up to 280 hours.
- **Entry diagnostic:** a 20 minute check in chapter 1.5: read and fix a small Express route, write one Mongoose query with a filter, explain a Git branch, and compute an ISBN-13 check digit from a worked example (this last item checks careful reading of a numeric rule, not prior book knowledge). Learners who miss two or more items go to the FreshMarket repair path before Module 2.

## Outcomes

| # | Outcome (observable verb) | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | **Model** a shared catalogue (Work, Edition) separately from shop-owned copies (Listing), with ownership that can be checked | `docs/erd.md`, seed data in Compass, viva answer on "why is Edition not owned by a shop" |
| O2 | **Implement** password hashing, role-aware JWT access tokens and refresh tokens for students, shop owners and an admin | curl transcript of register, verify, login, refresh; no readable passwords in the database |
| O3 | **Enforce** role and ownership checks so one shop cannot change another shop's copies, and nobody can rewrite a shared edition once copies exist | `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`, two-shop IDOR test returning 403 |
| O4 | **Split** one checkout into one order per shop and **snapshot** title, ISBN, grade, defects and price on each line | snapshot immutability test: regrade and reprice a sold copy, old order unchanged |
| O5 | **Take** payment with Stripe Payment Intents in test mode, gated on a verified webhook | test card payment, webhook log, orders marked paid |
| O6 | **Query** editions with their offers per grade without N+1 queries | logged query count before and after the aggregation |
| O7 | **Store** condition photos in object storage with only URLs in MongoDB | Cloudinary URLs on listings, small documents |
| O8 | **Cache** offer summaries with correct invalidation and **search** by exact ISBN and by indexed title or author | cache hit and miss timings, `explain()` showing index use |
| O9 | **Run** background jobs with retries and idempotency, including standing want-list matches that alert each student once per copy | worker logs, unique index on alerts, worker-down test |
| O10 | **Deploy** API, worker and client on HTTPS with secrets only in environment variables | live URL, `git log -- .env` empty, restart survival test |
| O11 | **Prevent** two students buying the same physical copy | two-tab race test: one 409 with a substitute suggestion |
| O12 | **Own** prices on the server, including grade-based suggestions and scheduled markdowns, with an audit trail | PaymentIntent amount equals server total, price change log |
| O13 | **Defend** the design in a demo and viva without notes | five-minute demo video, viva answers |

## Four-week shape

| Week | Focus | Modules | Hours | Demo at the end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations and the shared catalogue model | 1 to 8 | 51 | Both apps run; seed shows three shops, editions and graded copies in Compass; auth and the authorization matrix work |
| 2 | Shop experience and finding books | 9 to 17 | 57 | A shop types an ISBN, lists a graded copy with photos and price guidance; a student finds the edition, compares copies by grade, and fills a cart |
| 3 | Reading lists, commerce and the performance layer | 18 to 23 | 49 | A student matches a reading list across shops, pays with a Stripe test card, gets one order per shop with grade snapshots and collection codes; ISBN search and cached offers work; order jobs run in the worker |
| 4 | Hero completion, deploy and hardening | 24 to 27, 99, buffer | 53 (42 + 11 buffer) | Live on HTTPS: a missing title on the want-list triggers one alert when a shop lists it; two students race for the last copy; a markdown re-runs matches; capstone defense |
| | **Total core** | | **210** | |

## Module and chapter sequence

Status key: **Carry** means the FreshMarket module is reused almost unchanged (domain names and seed data only). **Adapt** means the same skill with a materially different build. **New** means a module FreshMarket does not have. FreshMarket module numbers are given in brackets.

## Capstone

- **What the learner ships:** Hamesh live on HTTPS, with API, worker and client deployed, seeded with three fictional shops, openly licensed textbooks and copies in every grade.
- **Five-minute demo:**
  1. A student imports the shop-published reading list for a first-year biology course and sets a grade floor of Good. The matcher fills three of four titles from two shops and shows one title as unmatched.
  2. The student adds the matches to the cart and saves the unmatched title to the want-list with a price ceiling.
  3. In another window, a shop owner types the missing book's ISBN-10. Hamesh normalises it to ISBN-13, finds the shared edition, and the owner lists a Very Good copy with a photo and a suggested price.
  4. Within seconds the student's alert inbox shows one alert for that copy. The learner republishes the copy to show that no second alert appears.
  5. The student adds the copy, pays with a Stripe test card, and sees two orders with grade snapshots and collection codes. The shop marks one order collected with the code.
  6. Two browser tabs race for the last copy of another edition: one pays, the other gets a 409 with a substitute copy.
- **Defense questions:**
  - Why is Edition shared and not owned by a shop, and who may change it?
  - Why is the grade stored as a number as well as a label?
  - What guarantees one edition per ISBN when two shops create it at the same moment?
  - What happens to want-list alerts if the worker is down when a copy is listed? What if the job runs twice?
  - Why do ISBN-13 numbers that start with 979 have no ISBN-10?
  - What did you snapshot on the order line, and what goes wrong if you skip the grade?
  - Why did you not build recommendations as the main feature?
- **Production requirements:** secrets only in environment variables; webhook signature verified; idempotent checkout and alerts; Redis-down fallback; rate limits on lookup and want-list creation; restart survival for API and worker.

## Variants

This roadmap is one variant of FreshMarket. The sibling rows are as briefed; each sibling's own roadmap holds its data-model delta and capstone.

| Variant | Primary user | Hardest constraint | Hero feature | Data-model delta | Capstone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FreshMarket (general) | Local grocery vendors and shoppers | Stock quantities and perishables across a split checkout | Multi-vendor cart split with price snapshots | Store, Product with stock, CartItem quantity | Browse to split paid orders, cached search, async jobs |
| **books (this roadmap)** | Students and small bookshops | One edition sold as many separate copies, each graded and priced on its own, matched to the exact edition a course needs | Reading-list matcher with want-list alerts | Work, Edition (shared), Listing (owned copy), ReadingList, WantListEntry, MatchAlert, PricingRule | Reading list matched across shops, live want-list alert, last-copy race |
| services | Freelancers and their clients | The cart holds booked time slots, not stock | Availability and booking | See services roadmap | See services roadmap |
| handmade | Artisans | One-off items and made-to-order requests | Custom order flow | See handmade roadmap | See handmade roadmap |
| home-kitchens | Home cooks and diners | Prep times, order cutoffs, delivery windows | Live order tracking | See home-kitchens roadmap | See home-kitchens roadmap |
| digital-goods | Creators of templates, fonts, ebooks | No shipping, instant delivery after payment | Licensing and signed download links | See digital-goods roadmap | See digital-goods roadmap |

## Out of scope

- **Students selling to students.** Paying private sellers needs connected accounts and payouts, which is a different trust and compliance problem. Shops are the only sellers. Buyback quotes to shops are a stretch lab.
- **Coupons.** FreshMarket's coupon engine is replaced by grade pricing and markdowns, which teach the same trust boundary in this domain.
- **Delivery and shipping rates.** Pickup at the shop with a collection code is the core path.
- **Machine-learning recommendations.** Untestable with seed data and not needed for the outcomes. A simple co-occurrence suggestion is a stretch lab.
- **Ebooks and digital delivery.** That is the digital-goods variant.
- **Real university integrations.** Reading lists are typed or copied inside Hamesh; no university systems are connected.
- **Automatic grading from photos.** The shop owner grades; Hamesh shows the evidence.
- **Live payments.** Stripe stays in test mode for the whole course.

## Open decisions for instructors

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Instructor decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Who can publish shared reading lists: students, shops, or both? | Shops publish lists per course code; students create private lists and can copy a shop's list. Avoids moderation work. | |
| 2 | Which condition scale? | Five grades (New, Like New, Very Good, Good, Acceptable) stored as ranks 5 to 1, plus separate defect flags (highlighting, handwriting, water damage, missing access code). | |
| 3 | Where does edition metadata come from? | Manual entry in core; Open Library lookup with cache and manual fallback as stretch S1, because the network is unreliable. | |
| 4 | Should an alert also hold the copy for the alerted student? | No. Alert only; the first student to reach checkout gets the hold. Simpler and easier to explain as fair. | |
| 5 | Who may correct a shared edition once copies exist? | Locked for shops; only the admin role can change it. Shops report errors in a notes field. | |
| 6 | Pickup only, or delivery too? | Pickup at the shop with a collection code in core; delivery out of scope. | |
| 7 | Keep any of FreshMarket's coupon chapters? | No. Module 27 replaces them with grade pricing and markdowns; same trust-boundary outcome. | |
| 8 | Which currency for Stripe test mode? | Integer minor units in code; currency chosen once in config. Instructors pick the currency shown in the demo. | |
| 9 | Hero placement: split across Modules 18 and 24, or one module after async jobs? | Split. The synchronous matcher is demoable in Week 3 even if a learner falls behind on queues. | |
