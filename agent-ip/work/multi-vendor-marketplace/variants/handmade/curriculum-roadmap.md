# Curriculum roadmap: Ghurza, a handmade marketplace (handmade variant of FreshMarket)

## In one paragraph

The learner builds **Ghurza** (working name), a marketplace where artisan workshops sell handmade work: tatreez embroidery, olive wood and ceramics. The hardest constraint is that many buyers want something that **does not exist yet**: they send a custom request, the maker replies with a quote, the buyer pays a deposit, the maker works for weeks and posts progress photos, the buyer approves and pays the balance, and the piece ships, often across borders. One order lives for weeks, involves two people taking turns, and takes money twice. Ready-made stock adds a second, smaller rule: each piece is **one of one**, so its inventory is a status, not a number, and it must sell exactly once. The learner keeps every FreshMarket outcome (ownership and isolation, a multi-vendor cart split into per-workshop orders with snapshots, Stripe test-mode payments with webhooks, caching, queues, deploy) but proves them on a product where inventory is a status, not a number, and where one order can take weeks and two payments. At the end the learner can run a commission end to end on a live HTTPS URL and defend why it cannot double-sell a piece or lose a deposit.

## Learner and entry prerequisites

- **Learner:** fellows in Gaza building tech careers. English is a second language. Many work on phones, with unreliable power and internet. Same learner as FreshMarket.
- **Prior knowledge:** same as FreshMarket: JavaScript, basic React, basic Express, one CRUD app built before, Git basics.
- **Time available:** 3 to 4 weeks at about 10 hours per day. Core path 210 hours, stretch to 257 hours.
- **Entry diagnostic:** same as FreshMarket (build a small CRUD route and a form), plus two short questions: "What goes wrong if two requests read a value, then both write it?" and "What is a webhook?" Both are taught in the course; the answers only place the learner.

## Outcomes

The outcomes are FreshMarket's outcomes. Only the evidence changes.

| # | Outcome (observable verb) | Evidence in Ghurza |
|---|---|---|
| O1 | **Model** a multi-party domain with clear ownership | ERD where a Workshop owns pieces and an Artisan is credited for them; seed with three workshops |
| O2 | **Secure** accounts with hashed passwords, short-lived JWTs and refresh | Curl flow register, verify, login, refresh; no readable passwords in the database |
| O3 | **Prevent** cross-tenant access at object level | Test: Workshop B gets 403 on Workshop A's request; Buyer B gets 403 on Buyer A's quote |
| O4 | **Split** one checkout into per-vendor orders with immutable snapshots | Two-workshop checkout makes two orders; editing a piece later leaves the order unchanged |
| O5 | **Guarantee** consistency under concurrency | Two-tab race on one piece: exactly one order, the other buyer gets 409 or an automatic test-mode refund |
| O6 | **Take** payment safely with Stripe test mode, webhooks and idempotency | Deposit and balance PaymentIntents; duplicate webhook events change nothing |
| O7 | **Run** a long-lived workflow as a guarded state machine | Commission timeline from request to delivered, every transition checked for actor and state |
| O8 | **Keep** slow work off the request path | Quote expiry, hold sweep and notifications run in a BullMQ worker |
| O9 | **Serve** reads fast and correct | Cached collection busts when a piece sells; text search uses an index (`explain()` shows it) |
| O10 | **Ship** and **defend** a production system | Live HTTPS URL, secrets in env, API and worker survive restart, five-minute demo and viva |

O7 is the FreshMarket order-status outcome (pending, packed, dispatched) taken further: the same skill, with more states, two actors and money at two points.

## Four-week shape

| Week | Focus | Modules | Hours | Demo at the end |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations | 1 to 7 | 49 | Both apps run; seed shows 3 workshops, 6 artisans, 12 pieces (2 sold) and 1 open custom request in Compass; buyer and maker can log in |
| 2 | Maker experience | 8 to 14 | 49 | Maker opens a workshop, adds artisans, lists a one-off piece with photos credited to an artisan, sets shipping zones and handling time; Workshop B gets 403 |
| 3 | Buyer and the one-off sale | 15 to 21 | 49 | Buyer adds pieces from two workshops, pays with a Stripe test card, sees two orders; a two-tab race on one piece produces exactly one sale |
| 4 | Commissions and ship | 22 to 27, Closing | 52 | On the live URL: request, quote, revised quote, deposit, progress photos, approval, balance, shipped, delivered |
| | Buffer | | 11 | |
| | **Core total** | | **210** | |

Hours are planning targets. The prerequisites and timeline agent re-sums chapter estimates at G2C and rejects the blueprint if the core path passes 210 hours.

## How this variant maps to FreshMarket

Key: **C** carries over almost unchanged (domain words and seed only), **A** is adapted (same outcome, different model or flow), **N** is new.

| Ghurza module | Mark | FreshMarket source | What changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Introduction | A | 01 | New product story; a short "writing about craft" rule set |
| 2 Project skeleton | C | 02 | Nothing material |
| 3 Why MongoDB | A | 03 | Craft attributes differ per craft; quote versions and progress updates as embedded history |
| 4 Config and database | C | 04 | Nothing material |
| 5 Data model and seed | A | 05 | Workshop, Artisan, Piece status, CustomRequest, Quote, Commission, ShippingProfile |
| 6 Authentication API | C | 06 | Roles are `buyer` and `maker` |
| 7 Login and registration | C | 07 | Role names only |
| 8 Authorization and isolation | A | 08 | Third object type: a commission has two parties; credit is not ownership |
| 9 Workshop API | A | 09 | Artisan roster, commission settings |
| 10 Open your workshop | A | 10 | Roster and commission settings pages |
| 11 Pieces API | A | 11 | Status machine instead of stock count; sold pieces stay as portfolio |
| 12 Maker dashboard | A | 12 | Status filters, craft fields, 409 handling |
| 13 Piece photos | C | 13 | Several ordered photos per piece instead of one |
| 14 Shipping profiles and lead times | N | none | Zones, handling and transit ranges, customs basics, paused shipping |
| 15 Browse the collection API | A | 14 | Sold pieces visible as portfolio; ships-to filter |
| 16 Shop the collection | A | 15 | Gallery cards, maker credit, "Request something similar" |
| 17 Cart API | A | 16 | No quantity; unavailable lines; shipping per workshop |
| 18 Your cart | A | 17 | Unavailable and ships-to warnings |
| 19 Checkout: sold exactly once | A | 18 and 24 | Per-piece holds move from post-deploy (FreshMarket 24) into core checkout |
| 20 Payment processing | A | 19 | Webhook turns holds into sales; late-success refund backstop |
| 21 Track orders | A | 20 | Packed, shipped (carrier name, tracking reference), received |
| 22 Custom requests | N | none | Hero, part 1 |
| 23 Quotes and deposits | N | 25 (outcome only) | Hero, part 2; FreshMarket's "server owns the total" outcome is taught on quotes |
| 24 Production and balance | N | none | Hero, part 3 |
| 25 Async jobs and queues | A | 22 | Delayed jobs: quote expiry, hold sweep, balance reminders |
| 26 Cache and search | A | 21 | Shorter; bust on sold; never trust cache for checkout |
| 27 Deploy | C | 23 | Smoke test includes a deposit payment on the live URL |
| 99 Closing | A | 99 | New bar-raiser and viva bank |

FreshMarket module 25 (coupon rules engine) is not in the core path. Its outcome, "never trust client totals", is kept and taught in module 23.

### Stretch path (optional, 47 hours, total 257)

| # | Module | One-line outcome | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | Arabic and English listings | Bilingual piece fields and a right-to-left layout that does not break | 8 |

### Canvases (two, both teach this variant's constraint)

| Canvas | Module | Inputs (2 to 4) | Claim the learner can state after | Stated limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lead-time range | 24 | Commissions ahead in the queue, maximum active at once, production days range, transit days range | "A ready date is a range that widens with the queue; show the range, not a promise" | Assumes the maker works the queue in order at a steady pace; real craft work varies |
| Deposit and cancellation | 24 | Quoted price, deposit percent, stage at cancellation, refund rule on the quote | "The terms copied onto the accepted quote and the stage recorded by the server decide the refund; deposit plus balance always equals the total" | One currency; ignores payment provider fees and partial material costs |

Neither canvas reuses FreshMarket's quantity-reservation model, and neither models a stock or copy race (single-copy holds are shared spine with the books variant and are taught in module 19 with a sketch and a test, not a canvas).

## Gate evidence at a glance

| Module | Gate evidence |
|---|---|
| 1 | Learner states the product, the three people, and the four writing rules |
| 2 to 4 | Client shows health with `db: connected`; no secrets in Git |
| 5 | Seed runs; `docs/erd.md` shows ownership vs credit and the two kinds of thing for sale |
| 6 to 7 | Buyer and maker register, verify and log in; silent refresh on 401 |
| 8 | Three IDOR tests return 403; `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md` committed |
| 9 to 10 | Workshop with two artisans created in the browser; second workshop rejected |
| 11 to 12 | Piece status changes only through allowed steps; edit of a sold piece returns 409 |
| 13 | Ordered photos in Cloudinary; only URLs in MongoDB |
| 14 | Piece page shows the right shipping answer for three buyer countries, including "not shipped here" and "paused" |
| 15 to 16 | Collection with filters and sold portfolio; fixed query count logged |
| 17 to 18 | Cart groups by workshop; a piece sold elsewhere shows as unavailable |
| 19 | Two-tab race gives exactly one hold; two-workshop checkout gives two orders; snapshot test passes |
| 20 | Test card payment marks pieces sold; duplicate webhook does nothing; late-success case refunded in test mode |
| 21 | Week 3 demo recorded |
| 22 | Buyer sends a request with reference photos; another buyer cannot read it |
| 23 | Stale quote version returns 409; deposit amount comes from the server; deposit webhook processed once |
| 24 | Commission timeline from in queue to delivered with photos; a stage-based cancellation refunds the right amount |
| 25 | Handler returns before the worker logs; quote expiry and hold sweep visible in Redis |
| 26 | Cache busts on sold; search uses an index |
| 27 | Live HTTPS URL; API and worker survive a restart |
| 99 | Capstone demo and viva |

## Capstone

- **What the learner ships:** Ghurza on a live HTTPS URL, with API, worker and client, seeded with fictional workshops, plus `docs/erd.md`, `docs/AUTHORIZATION.md`, a commission state diagram, a shipping and lead-time policy page, and `CHALLENGES.md`.
- **Five-minute demo:**
  1. A buyer in a country that one workshop does not ship to opens the cart: that workshop's piece shows "not shipped to your country". The buyer checks out one-off pieces from two other workshops and gets two orders, each with its own shipping amount and handling and transit ranges.
  2. A buyer opens a sold olive wood bowl and taps "Request something similar". The maker sends quote version 1, then version 2; accepting version 1 now fails.
  3. The buyer pays the deposit with a test card. The maker posts two progress updates with photos. The buyer approves, pays the balance, and the maker marks the piece shipped with a tracking reference.
  4. The maker dashboard shows the commission queue and the ready-window range for a new request. A second commission is cancelled during production and refunds exactly what its quote terms say.
- **Spine evidence submitted with the capstone, not demoed as the headline:** the module 19 two-tab race recording (one hold, one 409) and the module 20 late-success refund log.
- **Defense questions:**
  - How do you guarantee a piece is sold exactly once? Show the update.
  - Why two PaymentIntents and not one authorization captured later?
  - What happens if Stripe sends the deposit webhook twice, or the balance event before the deposit event?
  - The quote expires while the buyer is on the payment page. What happens, and which line of code decides it?
  - Who can read the buyer's reference photos? How did you test it?
  - Why does the product show ranges and never a delivery date?
  - What does the credited artisan see, and what do they control?
  - If you had to pay artisans for real, what would change, and what would you check first?
- **Production requirements:** same bar as FreshMarket: HTTPS, secrets only in env, API and worker survive a restart, webhook signature verified, rate limits on auth and request creation, no unscoped list routes, logs that show each commission transition.

## Variants

| Variant | Primary user | Hardest constraint | Hero feature | Data-model delta | Capstone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FreshMarket (general) | Local grocery shops and shoppers | Multi-vendor cart split, stock counts | One cart, per-vendor orders | Store, Product with `stockQty`, StockReservation | Two-store grocery checkout |
| **Handmade (this roadmap)** | Artisan workshops and buyers who want unique or custom work | Made to order: the piece is sold before it exists, through a weeks-long, two-party, two-payment workflow with honest lead times | Custom order flow: request, quote, deposit, production, balance, delivery | Workshop, Artisan (credit), Piece status and hold, CustomRequest, Quote (versioned), Commission (two payments), ShippingProfile | Full commission with deposit, progress, balance and a stage-based cancellation, plus a cross-border cart, on a live URL |
| Services | Freelancers and clients | Cart holds booked time slots | Availability and booking | See services roadmap | See services roadmap |
| Home kitchens | Home cooks and diners | Prep times, cutoffs, delivery windows | Live order tracking | See home-kitchens roadmap | See home-kitchens roadmap |
| Digital goods | Creators of templates, fonts, ebooks | No shipping; instant delivery after payment | Licensing and signed download links | See digital-goods roadmap | See digital-goods roadmap |
| Books | Students and small bookshops | Condition grades and used-item pricing | Search, and want-list alerts when a matching copy is listed | See books roadmap | See books roadmap |

## Out of scope

- **Real payouts to makers.** The course uses Stripe test mode on one platform account, like FreshMarket. Whether a payment provider can pay out to makers in a given country is a real-world question the course does not answer. Stretch S3 records what is owed; it does not move money.
- **Carrier integrations, labels and live tracking.** The maker types a carrier name and tracking reference. The course makes no claim about which routes or carriers are available from any place.
- **Duties and tax calculation.** The buyer is told import charges may apply. The platform does not compute them.
- **Multi-currency.** One platform currency.
- **Real-time chat.** Request threads are posted messages, refreshed on load.
- **Platform admin, disputes and moderation.** Same as FreshMarket: no admin panel.
- **Reviews and ratings.** Not needed to teach the outcomes.
- **"Notify me when available" and back-in-stock alerts.** A one-off piece never comes back, and saved-search alerts are the books variant's hero. The worker jobs in module 25 notify the two parties of an existing order or commission only.
- **Coupons and promotions (FreshMarket module 25).** The trust outcome is kept in module 23.

## Open decisions for instructors

| # | Decision | Recommendation | Instructor decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Product name. "Ghurza" is meant as the Arabic word for a stitch. | Keep as working name only after an Arabic-speaking instructor confirms spelling, meaning and that it reads well; otherwise use a plain English name | |
| 2 | Seed content: fictional makers only, or real artisans with consent? | Fictional workshops and makers in the seed. Photos must be the learner's own, openly licensed, or used with written permission. Real artisans may join the capstone only with consent | |
| 3 | Do seed workshops name real Palestinian cities as locations? | Leave location as free text the maker enters, and keep seed locations generic, so the course makes no claims about shipping from any place | |
| 4 | Move the sold-once guarantee into core week 3 (FreshMarket teaches reservations after deploy) | Yes. A one-off piece has no stock count to decrement, so checkout cannot be built without it. It stays spine (shared with books), not the hero | |
| 5 | Drop the coupon engine from core and teach its trust outcome on quotes | Yes | |
| 6 | Default deposit percent and refund-by-stage terms | Maker sets them within bounds; course default of 50 percent is a teaching choice, not an industry figure. Terms are copied onto each quote | |
| 7 | Balance payment on-session (core) vs saved card off-session | On-session in core; off-session in stretch S2 because authentication handling adds hours | |
| 8 | Checkout hold length | 15 minutes, same as FreshMarket, so the comparison is clean | |
| 9 | Buyer reference photos: authorized API listing with unguessable ids (core) vs signed delivery URLs | Authorized listing in core, with the limit stated. Signed delivery is the digital-goods hero; do not make it central here | |
| 10 | Auto-complete "delivered" a set number of days after "shipped" if the buyer never confirms | Yes, as a worker job, with the number of days set by the maker | |
| 11 | Arabic and right-to-left support: core or stretch? | Stretch S1, with schema fields ready from module 5 | |
| 12 | Cache and search cut to 5 hours | Accept; restore to 6 if instructors find the core under budget at G2C | |
| 13 | Boundary with the books variant | Books owns want-list alerts ("tell me when a matching copy is listed"). Ghurza has no "notify me when available" or back-in-stock alert anywhere: a sold piece leads to "Request something similar", which is a message to a maker, not a saved search. Both variants hold a single unit at checkout and run a two-tab race test: accepted as shared spine. Ghurza does not demo the race as its capstone headline and has no race canvas | |
